# PWN Audit Reports
This repository contains the security audit reports for PWN, a decentralized protocol for peer-to-peer lending. These reports are designed to promote transparency and demonstrate PWN's commitment to maintaining a secure and reliable platform.

PWN enables decentralized, trustless lending by allowing users to collateralize and borrow assets directly. Security is a core priority for PWN, and this repository provides access to the results of third-party audits and internal security assessments.

The reports in this repository detail:
- Vulnerabilities discovered during audits.
- Steps taken to mitigate identified issues.
- Security measures implemented to protect the protocol.
